           <h4>#10 Tohru Adachi</h4>
           <p><b>Arcana -</b> Jester/Hunger</p>
           <p><b>Dungeon -</b> Magatsu Inaba</p>
           <p>Tohru Adachi is a police detective as well as being Ryotaro Dojima's partner in <i>Persona 4.</i></p>
           <p>He regulary jokes about being Dojima's slave and complains about the workload included with being an officer, even in a town as small as Inaba. Although he appears to be a regular officer who regularly slacks off at Junes, his true personality is that of somebody who finds joy in hurting others.</p>
           <p>As a child, his parents only cared about the report card he brought home from school. He never had any friends, due to the constant workload he had to endure. This caused Adachi to feel as though he deserved to have a successful life with everything he could ever want in it. He even became an officer for the sake of being able to carry a gun, which excited him until he learned about being stationed in Inaba with Dojima.</p>
           <p>He had learned about the Midnight Channel through a gas station attendant, and decided to try it out, believing it to be just a rumor. When he learned that it was real and he could push people into the TV's himself he tried it out on his first victim, Mayumi Yamano. Adachi claimed that he came to investigate her, and when he refused to answer his questions about her affair, he got angry. He cornered her, and accidentally ended up pushing her into the TV. He was surprised at first, saying, "I didn't know they could go all the way in.." before laughing it off.</p>
                 
           <p>Mayumi's body was found by Adachi's second victim, Saki Konishi. He investigated her much more harshly than a usual investigation, and started making advances on her. When she refused these advances, he grew angry and threw her into the TV in the interrogation room.</p>

             <h4 class="p2">#9 Zenkichi Hasegawa</h4>
             <p><b>Arcana -</b> Apostle</p>
             <p class="p2">Zenkichi Hasegawa is a police inspector from the Kyoto prefecture in charge of investigating the new meta-verse change of hearts in <i>Persona 5: Strikers</i></p>
             <p class="p2">Zenkichi gives off the impression that he's another untrustworthy police officer, but he's truly intelligent and very easygoing. He doesn't conceal his motives, but is easily caught off-guard and made to panic. This usually involves him shouting in dismay. He has self-worth issues, caused by the death of his wife and his daughter's disdain towards him.</p>
             <p class="p2">Being unable to solve the case of his wife's death due to his job being on the line, he buried himself in his work to avoid thinking about anything. After realizing that her daughter's wrath was caused by his inability to bring justice to his wife and other victims, he realized how much of a hypocrite he was.</p>
             <p class="p2">With the help of the Phantom Thieves and awakening to his persona, he was able to start abiding by his own code of justice, and take down his wife's killer. He even starts to bridge the gap between himself and his daughter, Akane Hasegawa. He takes the role of the Phantom Thieves father throughout the game, since Sojiro didn't come with. The rest of the thieves even call him gramps.</p>
             <p class="p2">Zenkichi  eventually confronts Akira Konoe after his change of heart, and says that while he can't forgive him for using his daughter, he still wants him to atone for his sins and lead a better life.</p>

            <h4>#8 Rise Kujikawa</h4>
            <p><b>Arcana -</b> Lovers</p>
            <p><b>Dungeon -</b> Marukyu Striptease</p>
            <p>Rise Kujikawa is a singing idol in <i>Persona 4</i> who took a break from her career to live in Inaba.</p>
            <p>Rise is cheerful and outspoken, even being referred to as a "dangerous girl," from Chie Satonaka, due to her flirting with Yu and teasing of Yosuke Hanamura and Kanji Tatsumi. She's easily annoyed by small things, and due to her work as an idol, can produce crocodile tears and pretend to cry. She is known to be childish and possessive, telling Yu that he can't call other girls cute. She can be quite competitive, and once even mocked Yukiko's inability to cook, even though she didn't do much better herself.</p>
            <p>She took a break from being an idol, and cited health reasons as being the reason why. She's stressed out from the idol indrustry, and states that she "doesn't know who the real her is." She became an idol because she wanted to stop being bullied and get more friends. When it worked, however, she realized that nobody wanted to be friends with her because she was herself, but because she was the newly famous idol Risette.</p> 
            <p>She knows that nobody wants to see Rise Kujikawa and that they're only there for the manufactured Risette that she puts out on stage, which causes her to feel insecure about herself and her personality. By the end of her social-link, she realizes that running away from her issues didn't solve her problems and even considers going back into the industry once she feels better.</p>
