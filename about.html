            <p><b>Arcana -</b> The Chariot</p>
            <p><b>Codename -</b> Skull</p>
            <p>Ryuji is mostly noted as being a typical "annoying" comic relief character on the surface. Deep down, he's a selfless character who just wants others to be happy in what they do, as he doesn't want others to have to go through the same treatment that he did.</p>
            <p>He's commonly known to be a "problem student" in class, and is quite proud of his status as a troublemaker. He believes that his personality makes him fit to be a good Phantom Thief.</p>
            <p>Although having vulgar speech patterns, he will never become physically violent unless repeatedly provoked.</p>

            <p><b>Arcana -</b> The Lovers</p>
            <p><b>Codename -</b> Panther</p>
            <p>Ann is considered to be a kind and compassionate person, and is described as beautiful by others due to being a model. She feels that she's lost her place in the world due to being isolated from others at a young age. This never stops her from having fun with her friends, though.</p>
            <p>Although she usually appears happy, she's ridden with guilt due to the fact that she was unable to help her friend keep her position on the volleyball team, and eventually stop her from attempting suicide.</p>
            <p>She eventually overcomes this guilt during Kamoshida's palace, and decides to help Shiho with her physical therapy instead of feeling guilty.</p>

            <p><b>Arcana -</b> High Priestess</p>
            <p><b>Codename -</b> Queen</p>
            <p>Makoto gives off the impression of being an arrogant, selfish control freak. These rumors are untrue, as she's just a reserved person who likes to follow the rules.</p>
            <p>She's constantly overshadowed by how successful her older sister, Sae Nijima, is. This has led her to having no self-worth, and is why she continued to do what was expected of her and never questioned her authority. Goro Akechi refers to her as the, "good-girl type of pushover," in a very condescending manner.</p>
            <p>After defeating Junya Kaneshiro, she stays with the Phantom Thieves and states that she's done being the "exemplary honors student." She also states that she's going to be more honest with herself. She still likes to follow the rules well, even after she's done being Shujin's tool.</p>

            <p><b>Arcana -</b> Empress</p>
            <p><b>Codename -</b> Noir</p>
            <p>Haru is generally seen as being quiet and reserved, even being described as eccentric by some due to her tendency to keep to herself and avoid contact with others. She has trouble differentiating between people who want to genuinely be her friend and people who want to use her for her familial status.</p>
            <p>She's shown to have trust issues due to the people who just want to use her but even with this, she's still a kind-hearted person. She initially behaves very formally towards the rest of the Phantom thieves, but after being told that she doesn't need to be formal she eventually stops and even uses nicknames for some of the other characters.</p>
            <p>Haru's father is the palace of greed, and she initially wanted to infiltrate it so that she could get out of an abusive arranged relationship with her fiance. She agrees to join the Phantom Thieves after they helped change the heart of her father and get her out of the relationship she was in before.</p>

            <p>Her predictions are accurate and she can see even the most minute details, although her fortune telling costs 100,000 yen to start seeing her. She started being described as a monster in her hometown for her ability to tell the future, which led to her being discovered by the ADP chairman. Even after her time with the ADP, she continues fortune telling, as she likes doing it.</p>

            <p>Munehisa Iwai is the owner of "Untouchable," the airsoft shop in Shibuya. He shows interest in Akira due to his personality and knowledge on guns. He offers to sell the party real weapons in exchange for assisting with shady activies.</p>
            <p>He sells the Phantom Thieves the weapons that they use in the palaces and buys the treasure that they steal for a good amount of money. Building his confidant allows discounted prices to be set on his weapons. Growing up with a single mother who resorted to doing self-destructive things, he turned to the yakuza quickly. When he was forced to take in a child, he let go of the yakuza and decided to live a normal life and started Untouchable to support him and his son.</p>

            <p>This alias has caused her to become quite cynical and insecure, believing that she's only good for making experimental drugs, even after curing a young patient on the verge of death. She can tell when patients have ulterior motives when working with her, as she gets them often. Although being kind at heart as a doctor usually is, she gets easily annoyed by others and only decided to start selling Akira medicine because he accepted a deal to be his "guinea pig."</p>\

            <p>She initially acts cold towards Akira, believing him to be a good-for-nothing criminal due to the rumors surrounding the cause for his probation.

Once Akira finds out about her side-job as a maid, she agrees to do chores for him at Leblanc. Her confidant is increased through calling her to do chores.</p>

            <p>Because of her fathers death, she views the concept of justice as meaningless. This makes her highly competitive and obsessed with getting ahead in her job. Being envious of her sister and her colleagues, Sae felt that she should have free reign to do whatever she wants.</p>

Although appearing as a skilled speaker in public who puts a lot of care into influential speeches, his words are nothing but lies said to convince others to elect him Prime Minister. In reality, he's an ungrateful man who has a massive savior complex. He only cares about himself and the lapdogs who abide by him. </p>
            <p>He could care less about the future of Japan, and believes that the only people who should have a right to live are his associates. He despises everybody who gets in his way or irritates him even a little bit, and the consequences can range from lawsuits to being assassinated.</p>
